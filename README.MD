<center>## Welcome to Kynligbein's Roll-for-init repo!</center>

I am a student of CCAC's Data Analytics Technology program.  
This is my personal repository used to hold any additional learning projects for:
- Python
- QGIS
- PostgreSQL (or any database stuff learned in class)

At this time I only including a "peer tutorial" project from Python 2 class and continuing work done for my Python 1 final project for a random character generator for table top RPGs.
