The files in this folder are practice files using an online tutorial from 
FreeCodeCamp.org's (https://www.freecodecamp.org) "Giraffe Academy" (https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw) Python tutorial.  
They are extremely basic I used this to brush up on techniques learned in my Python 1 class at CCAC to help keep basic concepts fresh for Python 2. The alternative presentation to my professors instruction also has helped both my own coding style and understanding.  
The idea is to improve my python coding for personal projects and potential career use.
