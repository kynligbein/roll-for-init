
The Bloody Basic - Weird Fantasy Edition rpg is an OSR 
(Old School Revolution - Basically, it harkens back to the 
days of original D&D.) roleplaying game set in a fantasy 
world of demons, dragons, magic, and treasure! 

Weird fantasy is both steeped in meaning and bereft of it. 
It is quiet and noisy and ridiculous and sublime ... 
and makes an excellent place for players to explore and indulge 
their sense of wonder. Weird fantasy characters seek escape from 
the tedium and constrictions of the industrial age. They are 
errant knights, burglars, wise women, mystery priests and magicians.

They are bent on one last grand adventure, one chance to crack 
open the bones of drudgery and suck out the marrow of life, 
one final opportunity to live deeply and truly and transform 
the mundane into the beautiful ... are you?
