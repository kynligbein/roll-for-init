# <center>Random Character Generator</center>
### <center>Version 1.2.0</center>
Creates a randomized character for roleplaying as per the rules set in the Bloody Basic: Weird Fantasy RPG, with the inclusion of a homebrewed class called the "Wodwose" (a 'weird fantasy' variant of the Druid class).
<p>This program was originally submitted a final project for a Python 1 class in the CCAC Data Analytics Technology, AS program in Fall 2019. The updated version of the original program was finished 26 March, 2020.</p>
<p>Version 2 is currently under development and will include additional class and race options as outlined in "House Rules" documents as well as options for fully automated randomization or user selected choice. The final generated character sheet will also be output to a printable file.</p>
<p>Ultimately, future versions of this generator will allow for other rule books/RPG systems as well as a GUI interface.</p>
